### 👩‍💻 About Me
I’m currently studying at the Apple Developer Academy, where I’m expanding my skills in Swift development, innovation, and team collaboration according to challenge-based learning. This experience is helping me grow as a collaborative problem solver and creative thinker for different technologies during commitment with other people.
Before joining the Academy, I had experience in Technology Law as well as in research and innovation, where I focused on creating new opportunities for both organizations and individuals.
During this time, I also developed a strong interest in learning various technologies such as Python.
